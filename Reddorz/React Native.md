`view` is the basic bulding block of the mobile dev world all kind of visuals are the part of the diffrent types of views 
In the runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS,
we can invoke these views by using of the js it will create automatically generate the custom views for each platform(like android or web or ios, ) to capable of running in each of that. 

The components that we are talking about are called the `native components. 

Each components is denoting it view here. 

| React Native UI Component | Android View  | iOS View       | Web Analog              | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<View>`                  | `<ViewGroup>` | `<UIView>`     | A non-scrollingÂ `<div>` | A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls |
| `<Text>`                  | `<TextView>`  | `<UITextView>` | `<p>`                   | Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events                             |
Here that particualr `native compoenent ` is showing what kind of componenet it will mimic in the each type of platform possible various examples are there
