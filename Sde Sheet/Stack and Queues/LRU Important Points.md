Cache replacement algorithms are efficiently designed to replace the cache when the space is full

if some data is fetched or updated recently then the priority of that data would be changed and assigned to the ****highest priority**** the priority of the data ****decreases**** if it remains unused operations after operations.

#### Operations
`get` -> Use the value extract value this will increase priority of that value as we are using that
`c` -> the capacity of cache 
`put` to put the new value in the cache is here
